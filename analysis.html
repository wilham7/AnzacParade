Public Transport Hub
<ul>
	<li>Already a major bus access point to and from the University.</li>
	<li>Light Rail developments are obviously very significant for our precinct as the completion will drastically change the dynamic of the area.</li>
	<li>The introduction of the light rail along side the pre-existing bus network will take stress off other entrances but further add to the Anzac Parade entrance congestion.</li>
</ul>

Public Face of the University
<ul>
	<li>The Anzac Parade entrance of the Univeristy is the main impression the public get of the university.</li>
	<li>This area of the campus not only needs to be functional as an urban space but also aesthetically pleasing. </li>
	<li>Not all opportunities have been utilised to interweave form and function; an example being the bollards. </li>
	<li>As the "front door" of the University, the area is responsible for distributing people around the campus</li>
</ul>

Desire Lines
<ul>
	<li>When people walk they will take the most convenient path and not predefined ones.</li>
	<li>Movement through dirt and grass isn't random and scattered, but instead forms distinct trails.</li>
	<li>The paths and greenery in the precinct are therefore in the wrong spots.</li>
</ul>

Comparative and Preditive Analysis
<ul>
	<li>The interactive map can be used to compare relevant data and get the most insightful understandings about the precinct.</li>
	<li>By modelling the planned Light Rail changes, we can accurately anticipate and predict issues that the area will face.</li>
